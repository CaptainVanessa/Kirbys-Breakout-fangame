Hi! Thank you for taking an interest in my game.

I started learning code in February 2022. After two weeks of learning Python, I then made this game in about five days, using Pygame Zero.

You can also play this game by downloading the .exe file available on my itch page: https://captainvanessa.itch.io/kirbys-breakout-fangame
